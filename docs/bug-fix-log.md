# Bug fix log of this project

- [x] 1. Can't pass all test in package: dbops

    **Solution**:
    1. Did not know that **`init`** method is a special method in golang.
    2. And because of my careless problem: didn't use `:=` and `=` in coding. Shame on me. :/
    3. Thanks to the warm-hearted buddy in a QQ group,which added me and help me to solve the bug. :)
